# UNet: semantic segmentation with PyTorch

## Files

For the project, the notebook files are listed in required order. 

- EDA - Tries to carry out basic analysis of the data

- U-Net - This runs the train and predict on our model from the repo listed

- Semantic Segmentation in cars - A notebook which contains the use of default SageMaker models for segmentation tasks

The dataset is available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge/data). This folder isn't included in the zip folder of this project.
